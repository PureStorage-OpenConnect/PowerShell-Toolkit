# Pure Storage PowerShell-Toolkit

The new version of the Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit leverages a number of different cmdlets ranging from core Windows Server, WMI, WSMAN, VMware PowerCLI, SQL Server and .NET assemblies. The intention of the toolkit is to provide a library for customers and the Pure Storage field to use in troubleshooting, FlashArray reporting and other useful utilities.

All releases of the Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit will be distributing through the PowerShell Gallery, https://powershellgallery.com.
