# PowerShell-Toolkit 3.x

This new version of the PowerShellToolkit leverages a number of different cmdlets ranging from core Windows Server, WMI, WSMAN, VMware PowerCLI, SQL Server, .NET and a host of others. The intention of the toolkit is to provide a library for customers and the Pure Storage field.
