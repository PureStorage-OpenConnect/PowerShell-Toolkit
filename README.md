# PowerShell-Toolkit 3.x

The new version of the Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit leverages a number of different cmdlets ranging from core Windows Server, WMI, WSMAN, VMware PowerCLI, SQL Server and .NET assemblies. The intention of the toolkit is to provide a library for customers and the Pure Storage field to use in troubleshooting, FlashArray reporting and other useful utilities.

All releases of the Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit will have a digitally signed (MSI and Script Module).
